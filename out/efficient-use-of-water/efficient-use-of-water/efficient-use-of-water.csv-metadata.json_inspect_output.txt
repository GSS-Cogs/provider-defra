          - Comment: Water leakage in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, measured in megalitres per day
          - Description: Climate change and a growing population will put increasing pressure on our water supplies. Ambitious reductions in water consumption and leakage have a significant role in maintaining secure supplies and protecting the environment. This indicator shows changes in the efficient use of water, focussing on leakage. Leakage in England is an existing metric reported to The Water Services Regulation Authority (Ofwat) and the Environment Agency.
