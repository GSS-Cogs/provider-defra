          - Identifier: Efficient use of water
          - Comment: Water leakage in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, measured in megalitres per day
          - Description: Climate change and a growing population will put increasing pressure on our water supplies. Ambitious reductions in water /nconsumption and leakage have a significant role in maintaining secure supplies and protecting the environment. This indicator /nshows changes in the efficient use of water, focussing on leakage. Leakage in England /nare existing metrics reported to The Water Services Regulation Authority (Ofwat) and the Environment Agency.
