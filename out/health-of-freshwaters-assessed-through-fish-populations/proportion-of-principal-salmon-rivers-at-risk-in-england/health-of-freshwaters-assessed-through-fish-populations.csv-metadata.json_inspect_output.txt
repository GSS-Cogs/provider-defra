          - Comment: The proportion of principal salmon rivers at risk in England
          - Description: This indicator tracks changes in populations of native freshwater fish in England. Fish are a good indicator of
		healthy freshwater environments, responding to changes in water quality (including temperature) and quantity,
		as well as the quality of river habitats, necessary to sustain healthy populations and enable migration throughout
		rivers to allow fish to complete their life cycles. Fish also provide an important recreational and economic benefit
		from freshwaters.  
		This indicator is not available for reporting in 2023 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that
		shows the proportion of principal salmon rivers at risk in England.  
		This dataset is sourced from annually published national salmon stock data. For this assessment, each river's
		salmon stocks are placed into one of 4 categories: at risk; probably at risk; probably not at risk; and not at risk.
		These categories reflect the level of resilience of salmon stocks in each river in relation to biological reference
		points.
