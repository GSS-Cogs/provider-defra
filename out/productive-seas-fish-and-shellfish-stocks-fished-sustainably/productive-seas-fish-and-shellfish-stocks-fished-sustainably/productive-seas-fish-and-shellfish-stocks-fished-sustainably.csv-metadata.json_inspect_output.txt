          - Comment: Proportion of commercial fish and shellfish stocks that are within safe biological limits and fished sustainably
          - Description: This dataset tracks changes in the proportion of commercial fish and shellfish stocks that are within safe biological limits and
		fished sustainably. The indicator is derived from assessments of individual stocks. Where available, the assessment of stocks against their
		Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) will be incorporated into the overall indicator. The indicator is linked to UK Marine Strategy
		Descriptor 3 (Commercial Fish and Shellfish) and the Convention on Biological Diversity sustainable fisheries indicators and
		is derived from International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and national stock assessments.  
		This interim indicator shows the proportion of stocks of UK interest fished at or below the level capable of producing MSY (FMSY); and
		the proportion of stocks with spawning stock biomass (SSB) above the level capable of producing MSY (MSY Btrigger).  
		The assessments used for this interim indicator have been reported under the [UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/marine-strategy-part-one-uk-updated-assessment-and-good-environmental-status)
		using data from 1990 to 2015 for FMSY and from 1990 to 2016 for MSY Btrigger.
		Data on [commercially exploited fish and shellfish](https://moat.cefas.co.uk/pressures-from-human-activities/commercial-fish-and-shellfish),
		analytical methods and assessment are available. Data are also published annually in the [UK Biodiversity Indicator B2 - Sustainable fisheries](https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/ukbi-b2-sustainable-fisheries).
